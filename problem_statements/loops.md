# User input loop until 0 is entered
# Sample inputs: 5, 3, 0
```

#### **Expected Output:**
```
Exited

These problems cover basic loop concepts using both the `for` and `while` loops in Python. They allow beginners to practice iteration, accumulation, and breaking out of loops.

Here are **additional problems** involving the use of `break` and `continue` statements in loops for **beginners**.

### **Problem 8: Finding Prime Numbers (Using `break` and `continue`)**
#### **Problem Statement:**
Write a program to find and print the first `N` prime numbers. If a number is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself, skip it using the `continue` statement. If a number is found to be prime, print it. Use `break` to stop after printing `N` prime numbers.

#### **Inputs:**
```python
N = 5
```

#### **Expected Output:**
```
2
3
5
7
11
```

#### **Solution Code:**
```python
N = 5
count = 0
num = 2
while count < N:
    for i in range(2, num):
        if num % i == 0:
            break
    else:
        print(num)
        count += 1
    num += 1
```

#### **Test Cases:**

| Input | Expected Output  |
|-------|------------------|
| 3     | 2, 3, 5          |
| 4     | 2, 3, 5, 7       |
| 6     | 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13 |

### **Problem 9: Skipping Even Numbers (Using `continue`)**
#### **Problem Statement:**
Write a program that prints all odd numbers from 1 to `N`. Use the `continue` statement to skip even numbers.

#### **Inputs:**
```python
N = 10
```

#### **Expected Output:**
```
1
3
5
7
9
```

#### **Solution Code:**
```python
N = 10
for i in range(1, N + 1):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        continue
    print(i)
```

#### **Test Cases:**

| Input | Expected Output  |
|-------|------------------|
| 7     | 1, 3, 5, 7       |
| 12    | 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 |
| 15    | 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15 |

### **Problem 10: Stopping After Specific Number (Using `break`)**
#### **Problem Statement:**
Write a program that prints numbers from 1 to `N`, but stops the loop if the number is equal to `X`. Use the `break` statement to stop the loop.

#### **Inputs:**
```python
N = 10
X = 6
```

#### **Expected Output:**
```
1
2
3
4
5
```

#### **Solution Code:**
```python
N = 10
X = 6
for i in range(1, N + 1):
    if i == X:
        break
    print(i)
```

#### **Test Cases:**

| Input (N, X) | Expected Output  |
|--------------|------------------|
| (10, 6)      | 1, 2, 3, 4, 5    |
| (8, 4)       | 1, 2, 3          |
| (15, 10)     | 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 |

These problems introduce how `break` and `continue` can be used in loops to control flowâ€”`break` for terminating a loop early and `continue` for skipping specific iterations of the loop.
