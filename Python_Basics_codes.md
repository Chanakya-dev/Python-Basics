Here are **15 Python codes** specifically designed to help you understand the topics under "Python Basics":

---

### **1. Syntax and Indentation**

    print("This is correctly indented.")
else:
    print("This will execute if the condition is False.")
```

---

### **2. Variables and Data Types - Integer**
```python
x = 10  # Integer
print("Integer:", x)
```

---

### **3. Variables and Data Types - Float**
```python
y = 3.14  # Float
print("Float:", y)
```

---

### **4. Variables and Data Types - String**
```python
name = "Alice"  # String
print("String:", name)
```

---

### **5. Variables and Data Types - Boolean**
```python
is_active = True  # Boolean
print("Boolean:", is_active)
```

---

### **6. Variable Reassignment**
```python
value = 100  # Assign an integer
value = "Python"  # Reassign to a string
print("Variable now holds a string:", value)
```

---

### **7. Comments - Single Line**
```python
# This is a single-line comment
print("Single-line comments begin with a # symbol.")
```

---

### **8. Comments - Multi-Line**
```python
"""
This is a multi-line comment.
It spans multiple lines.
"""
print("Multi-line comments are enclosed in triple quotes.")
```

---

### **9. Print Statement with Concatenation**
```python
name = "Bob"
age = 30
print("Name: " + name + ", Age: " + str(age))
```

---

### **10. Print Statement with f-Strings**
```python
name = "Alice"
age = 25
print(f"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old.")
```

---

### **11. Input Function - String Input**
```python
username = input("Enter your name: ")
print("Welcome, " + username + "!")
```

---

### **12. Input Function - Numeric Input**
```python
number = int(input("Enter a number: "))  # Convert input to integer
print("You entered:", number)
```

---

### **13. Combining Input and Variables**
```python
name = input("What's your name? ")
age = int(input("How old are you? "))
print(f"Hello {name}, you are {age} years old!")
```

---

### **14. Type Checking with `type()`**
```python
x = 42
y = 3.14
z = "Python"
print(type(x))  # Output: <class 'int'>
print(type(y))  # Output: <class 'float'>
print(type(z))  # Output: <class 'str'>
```

---

### **15. Multi-Line Strings**
```python
long_text = """Python is a versatile language.
It is great for beginners and professionals alike."""
print(long_text)
```

---

These examples focus on syntax, indentation, variables, data types, comments, and basic I/O using `print()` and `input()`. You can tweak these examples to explore their behavior further.

```python
pi = ____
print(pi)
```

---

### **4. Variables - String**
Fill in the blanks to assign the string "Hello, Python!" to the variable `greeting`:
```python
____ = "Hello, Python!"
print(____)
```

---

### **5. Variables - Boolean**
Assign the boolean value `True` to the variable `is_active`:
```python
____ = True
print(is_active)
```

---

### **6. Reassigning Variables**
Reassign the variable `value` to "Learning Python":
```python
value = 42
value = ____
print(value)
```

---

### **7. Single-Line Comment**
Add a comment explaining the purpose of the following line:
```python

```python
"""
This is an example of a multi-line comment.
______________________________________________________
"""
print("Multi-line comments are useful for documentation.")
```

---

### **9. Print Statement - Concatenation**
